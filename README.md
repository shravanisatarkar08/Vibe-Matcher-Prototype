# Vibe-Matcher-Prototype
Vibe Matcher is a prototype recommendation system matching products to a user’s natural-language “vibe” query. It uses SentenceTransformers embeddings and cosine similarity to return top-3 matches, handles low-similarity queries, and can be extended with OpenAI embeddings or a vector DB.
